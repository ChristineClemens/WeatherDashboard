# Weather Dashboard
### Description
This application was designed with the intention of providing the user with a weather dashboard capable of detecting and displaying local weather, as well as accommodating search queries to display the weather conditions present in the desired locales. The goal of this project is to allow users to effectively plan their travels around the current and forecasted weather available in each location to optimize their trip. 

##### User Story

### Usage
In order to employ this application as effectively as possible, please access the deployed application here:    

Upon opening this application in your browser, you will be prompted to allow the application to access your location; in selecting "allow", you will allow the application to display your local weather. If you have recently searched a locale, the last item saved to your local storage will appear rather than the default local weather information.     
In order to perform a search, you will need to input a city name, and two-character city code in the indicated format, "City, CC" (Ex. Toronto, CA). When you subsequently click the "Seach" button below, the weather for the searched city will be generated and stored below so that you may access this city in order to compare search query results.
